- Yang, W., Mackintosh, A.N., Chu, W., & Li, Y., (2025): Global Glacier Climate Disequilibrium: Committed Mass Loss and Sea Level Rise.

we quantify global glacier disequilibrium in the present-day climate (2014-2023) using a parameterization approach, leveraging global ice thickness, geodetic mass balance, debris cover, and frontal ablation data. This approach estimates the area perturbation required to bring the present-day glacier into equilibrium based on a fractional disequilibrium ratio of the current glacier accumulation area ratio to its equilibrium value. The mass loss for the adjustment can then be estimated using area-volume scaling. All simulations are based on a hybrid of [Python Glacier Evolution Model (PyGEM v0.2.5)](https://github.com/PyGEM-Community/PyGEM/releases/tag/v0.2.0), developed by David Rounce and collaborators, and [Open Global Glacier Model (OGGM v1.6.0)](https://github.com/OGGM/oggm/releases/tag/v1.6.0), developed by the OGGM community.
